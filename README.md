# Awesome CSS Projects

This is a monorepo containing sub-project. Each project will be compiled to Docker image and deployed to AWS Lambda (serverless) as microservices which are managed by Kubernetes clusters to dynamically scale resources based on bandwidth and incoming requests to perform load balancing on multiple servers and induce ratelimiting upon spam bots to prevent DDOS.....

ðŸ˜†<b>Kidding</b>, I have no idea what I'm talking abount. This is just bunch of CSS projects from [Hyperplexed's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed).

> Each folder contains a story to tell. Dont forget to "readme".

I'm working as a full-stack developer, need to juggle between frontend and backend; but my heart will always be on frontend. As we all know, frontend dev is getting crazier day by day. New javascript framework appeared every month, SSR, signals, server actions, etc. It makes me forgot what web development is all about. Btw, Tailwind CSS and Material UI does indeed sped up my workflow, but I kinda miss the old-school way, Hence, I'll occasionally do simple projects like this so that I wont forget my roots; vanilla CSS.

- Btw, after a very long time I realized that I spelt the channel's name wrong lol. It should've been "Hyperplexed". Not "Hyperflexed". I'm so sorryyyyyy. Maybe I need to flex my muscles less from now on ðŸ’ªðŸ˜”.
