> Ahhhh css animation. I have such a love hate relationship with you.

This time we're creating an effect where part of the text having animated gradient color. And also sparkling stars!

## Logs

1. The animated gradient itself looks pretty dang sweet! `background-clip` is awesome.

2. Hyperflex uses christmas-star for his star icon, which is only available on Font Awesome pro. I used a star free version. Doensn't looks as cool but it gets the job done.

3. Fortunately I found out that he shared his magical-text codes on Codepen, and I found the christmas-star svg there. Copied it and tadaa, I have a good looking stars too. Is this legal? XD

4. And as always, the javascript going from "OK, understandable" to "What the fuck is going on?".
