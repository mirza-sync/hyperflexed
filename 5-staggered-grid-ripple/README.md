# Staggered Grip Ripple

> Pixelated ripple effect that changes color on every click! _(Feat anime.js)_

Ok this time, instead of creating the ripple effect from scratch using CSS, we'll be using [anime.js](https://animejs.com/). It's not cheating. People made animation libraries to make animating easy. So why not leveraging it right?

## Dev Logs

1. So, this effect need to start with creating tiles. The tiles were created using CCS grid... with outlines (So that we can see the tiles).

2. But what's more awesome than tiles? Responsive tiles! When the screen resizes, the number of tiles changes dynamically. And the tiles aspect ratio weren't affected at all, so cool!.
