# Staggered Grip Ripple

> Pixelated ripple effect that changes color on every click! _(Feat anime.js)_

Ok this time, instead of creating the ripple effect from scratch using CSS, we'll be using [anime.js](https://animejs.com/). It's not cheating. People made animation libraries to make animating easy. So why not leveraging it right?

## Dev Logs

1. So, this effect need to start with creating tiles. The tiles were created using CCS grid... with outlines (So that we can see the tiles).

2. But what's more awesome than tiles? Responsive tiles! When the screen resizes, the number of tiles changes dynamically. And the tiles aspect ratio weren't affected at all, so cool!.

3. Btw, this tutorial also have the animated linear gradient background. It was still a cool thing nevertheless. Can't get enough of it, XD

4. And as usual, he doesn't fully show the step to make the gradient background to appear at the tiles' border. He either want people to figure things out themselves, or he just forgot.
