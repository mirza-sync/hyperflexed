1. I've set the body's `width: 100vw` and `height: 100vh`, the add `overflow: hidden`. But the scroll bars were still there. Why??? Need to google it and found out that every body element have a default padding to it. Can't beleive that I forgot this basic stuff. I've learned this years ago in W3School hahahahaha (Feeling dumb currently).

   > Hope I won't google on how to center a div inside another div. `display: grid; place-items: center`. Future me pls dont forget this. ðŸ˜‰
