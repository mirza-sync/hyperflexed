The first css video in Hyperflexed's channel. His engaging presentation and soothing voice really hooked me up. Subscribed.

## Logs

1. Today I learned about `::before` pseudo element. It was used to insert content to an element without introducing a new element. I thought it will be used to insert image or icon, but he's inserting glows! Pretty cool!

2. I have no idea why there's multiple z-indexes on each classes. The `.card` is the parent element. Both the children (`.card-border` and `.card-content`) is covering its parent entirely. So I think z-index on `.card::before` is already enough.
