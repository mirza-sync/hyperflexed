## Dev Logs

1. Haven't done this vanilla CSS project for a long time. I'm excited! ðŸ˜†

2. This tutorial use bunch of `clamp`s for font-size and margin and padding. The spacing change dynamically when the screen resizes. Urghhhh, so satisfying ðŸ¤¤.

3. I ran the project, and the text uses "Ibara Real Nova" font. Where does it came from? I didn't import it from Google Fonts. Does it baked in Chrome just like "Roboto" font? (Btw Ibara is such a weird name for a font).

4. Damnnn, is it that easy to create simple yet elegant hover effect? Refer commit [9674a77](9674a77b6bd8ab2d2d82e4aff1d158062a8738b3).
